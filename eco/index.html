		<div class="texteco">Ecology is the knowledge of the economy of nature, the simultaneous study of all the relationships of life with organic and inorganic components of the environment ... In a word, ecology is a science that studies all the complex relationships in nature, considered by Darwin as conditions for the struggle for existence.</div>

		<div class="textinfo">All creatures on Earth do not live by themselves, but in interaction with each other and with the environment that surrounds them. These interactions are studied by ecology. As long as there is a balance in nature (plants have enough soil nutrients, animals - plant mass, humans - food and resources), ecology remains an armchair science, about which people know little. But as soon as the balance is disturbed, an ecological crisis arises, and this science becomes one of the most important.</div>

		<div class="textblog">Today, the term "ecology" has become used very widely, on a variety of occasions (in the case and not in the case). And this process, apparently, is irreversible. However, the excessive expansion of the concept of "ecology" and its inclusion in jargon is still unacceptable. So, for example, they say that the city has "bad ecology". The expression is meaningless, because ecology is a scientific discipline and it is one for all mankind. We can talk about a bad ecological situation, about unfavorable ecological conditions, about the lack of qualified ecologists in the city, but not about bad ecology. It's as ridiculous as saying that the city has bad arithmetic or algebra. For more details see: https://www.nkj.ru/archive/articles/10376/ (Science and life, ECOLOGY IN THE MODERN WORLD)
